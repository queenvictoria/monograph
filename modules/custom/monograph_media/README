1	register a hook_theme at a particular path in .module
2	pass in variables at hook_file_formatter_FORMATTER_view in formatters.inc
3	pick up variables again in the preprocessor in includes/themes/theme.inc eg monograph_media_preprocess_monograph_media_video
4	finally use the variables there writing the html . presumably there could be a monograph-media-video.tpl.php file too . which would take precedence ?

fields are edited in the media library NOT the node editor. http://drupal.org/node/703336

@todo

v	fields (caption/description/credit)
-	why can't we get text info from providers ?
v	handle missing fields (caption)
v	pass in all fields (caption etc)
-	configure or create image style size (eg: imagecache size)
-	enable the monograph video display for preview at least (preview comes from youtube i think)
-	use our themer to handle images too .
